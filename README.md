# Sorting Algorithms

## Description
This project is part of the Holberton School curriculum.  
It focuses on understanding and implementing different sorting algorithms,
their time complexities using Big O notation, and choosing the appropriate
algorithm depending on the input data.

## Learning Objectives
At the end of this project, I am able to explain:

- At least four different sorting algorithms
- What Big O notation is and how to evaluate time complexity
- How to choose the best sorting algorithm depending on the input
- What a stable sorting algorithm is

## Sorting Algorithms Covered
- Bubble Sort
- Selection Sort
- Insertion Sort
- Quick Sort

## Big O Notation
Big O notation describes the performance or complexity of an algorithm.
It focuses on how the execution time grows relative to the input size.

Examples:
- O(1): Constant time
- O(n): Linear time
- O(n²): Quadratic time
- O(log n): Logarithmic time
- O(n log n): Linearithmic time

## Requirements
- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- Compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using:
gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89
- Code follows the Betty style
- No global variables
- No more than 5 functions per file
- No standard library functions allowed (except provided ones)
- All prototypes are declared in `sort.h`
- All header files are include guarded
- Lists or arrays with fewer than two elements are not sorted
